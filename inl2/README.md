# Task

Create a program doing the following:

1. Take a startnumber for a runner > 0, e.g. 33
2. Take starttime for said runner, hh-mm-ss
3. Take endtime for same runner, hh-mm-ss
4. Calculate running time (endtime - starttime)
5. Store as best time if better than current best time
6. Goto 1 if startnumber > 0
7. If startnumber <= 0 continue;
8. Print winner startnumber, their runningtime, and no. of runners

## Rules & caveats

1. Program should work with times passing 12AM
2. Order of startnumbers should not matter
3. No need to validate double entry of startnumber
4. No need to validate input hh, mm, ss
5. No limit for number of runners
6. Use of arrays not allowed
7. cin with keyboard, cout on screen
8. No validation of input required
9. Assume there is only one winner.
